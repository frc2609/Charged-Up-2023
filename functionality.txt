Improvements:
Merge ECVT class & SwerveMotorGroup
Move XboxControllers to static-only member of RobotContainer? maybe not because it's not going to be initialized
^^^ Custom array to hold ECVTModuleState?
-> Rotation2d for rotation
-> Boost throttle
-> metres per second
-> Torque throttle
^^^ still have SwerveModuleState
Remove unused autos
Move commands into appropriate folders
Gripper should NOT be the same subsystem as arm
CommandXboxController instead of XboxController
Go through BeaverLogger and improve it/remove unused values and add titles for ones being logged
Make it easier to import arm profiles
-> Error checking if an invalid profile is selected
change the swerve dimensions in constants to the actual swerve dimensions please

Functionality:
Limelight tracking
Align-To-Rotation (DPAD?)
Integrate arm kinematics with robot code (much easier to change setpoints)
-> Probably not because python one has graphing (can't port) and would take long to port the math
Lock swerve drive on the balance platform
Swerve needs to drift less (does it drift?)
