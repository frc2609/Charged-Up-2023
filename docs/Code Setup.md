# Setting up this repo

## External/Vendor Libraries
* PathPlannerLib: https://3015rangerrobotics.github.io/pathplannerlib/PathplannerLib.json
* NavX: https://dev.studica.com/releases/2023/NavX.json
* REVLib: https://software-metadata.revrobotics.com/REVLib.json

**Note:** Install REVLib offline or deploy the code while online at least once, or your computer will not have a locally cached version of the Spark Max drivers for the RoboRIO (i.e. code will crash after deploying it).
* It's probably a good idea to deploy the code while online at least once anyways, because the other vendor libraries may not be cached on your computer.
