* All this should be converted to metres for use in Java code.

## Scoring
**Combined Node Vertical Offsets**
* See Cube or Cone node `Lower` position.

**Cube Node Vertical Offsets**
| Position | Height           | From Grid Front | Shoulder Pos | Wrist Pos |
| -------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Lower    | 0 in.            | 0 in.           |              |           |
| Middle   | 1 ft. 11 1/2 in. | 1 ft. 2 1/4 in. |              |           |
| Upper    | 2 ft. 11 1/2 in. | 2 ft. 7 5/8 in. |              |           |
* From Grid Front = Distance from grid front to start of node
* Should position be measured in degrees?

**Cone Node Vertical Offsets**
| Position | Height       | From Grid Front  | Shoulder Pos | Wrist Pos |
| -------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Lower    | 0 in.        | 0 in.            |              |           |
| Middle   | 2 ft. 10 in. | 1 ft. 10 3/4 in. |              |           |
| Upper    | 3 ft. 10 in. | 3 ft. 3 3/4 in.  |              |           |
* From Grid Front = Distance from grid front to start of node

**Node Horizontal Offsets**
| Position | Dist. From Centre   |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| Left     | _ ft. _ in. [Left]  |
| Middle   | 0 in.               |
| Right    | _ ft. _ in. [Right] |
* These are the distance from the AprilTag centre to the centre of the node.

## Limelight
* All AprilTags are from the `16h5` tag family.

**Red Alliance AprilTags**
| Grid  | AprilTag |
| ----- | -------- |
| Left  | ID 3     |
| CO-OP | ID 2     |
| Right | ID 1     |
* Grid naming is relative to the CO-OP grid.

**Blue Alliance AprilTags**
| Grid  | AprilTag |
| ----- | -------- |
| Left  | ID 8     |
| CO-OP | ID 7     |
| Right | ID 6     |
* Grid naming is relative to the CO-OP grid.

**Scoring AprilTags**
| Station     | AprilTag |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Blue Double | ID 5     |
| Red Double  | ID 4     |
* Single Stations have no AprilTags.
