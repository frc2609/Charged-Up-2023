## Scoring
**Combined Node Vertical Offsets**
* See Cube or Cone node `Lower` position.

**Cube Node Vertical Offsets**
| Position | Height              | From Grid Front       |
| -------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Lower    | 0 in. (0 m)         | 0 in. (0 m)           |
| Middle   | 23.5 in. (0.5969 m) | 14.25 in. (0.36195 m) |
| Upper    | 35.5 in. (0.9017 m) | 31.625 in. (0.8033 m) |
* From Grid Front = Distance from grid front to start of node

**Cone Node Vertical Offsets**
| Position | Height            | From Grid Front       |
| -------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Lower    | 0 in. (0 m)       | 0 in. (0 m)           |
| Middle   | 34 in. (0.8636 m) | 22.75 in. (0.5779 m)  |
| Upper    | 46 in. (1.1684 m) | 39.75 in. (1.00965 m) |
* From Grid Front = Distance from grid front to start of node

**Node Horizontal Offsets**
| Position | Dist. From Centre         |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| Left     | 22 in. [Left] (0.5588 m)  |
| Middle   | 0 in. (0 m)               |
| Right    | 22 in. [Right] (0.5588 m) |
* These are the distance from the AprilTag centre to the centre of the node.

## Limelight
* All AprilTags are from the `16h5` tag family.

**Red Alliance AprilTags**
| Grid  | AprilTag |
| ----- | -------- |
| Left  | ID 3     |
| CO-OP | ID 2     |
| Right | ID 1     |
* Grid naming is relative to the CO-OP grid.

**Blue Alliance AprilTags**
| Grid  | AprilTag |
| ----- | -------- |
| Left  | ID 8     |
| CO-OP | ID 7     |
| Right | ID 6     |
* Grid naming is relative to the CO-OP grid.

**Scoring AprilTags**
| Station     | AprilTag |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Blue Double | ID 5     |
| Red Double  | ID 4     |
* Single Stations have no AprilTags.
